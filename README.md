# UVA Online Judge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to a variety of algorithmic problems from the [UVA Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/)
It was my private folder, that was recommitted to a public repository
## 📁 Folder Structure

All solutions are stored in the `oj/` folder and written in **C++**.  
Each file follows the naming convention `ojX.cpp`, where `X` is the problem index.

oj/ ├── oj1.cpp ├── oj2.cpp ├── oj3.cpp ├── ...

## 🧠 Topics Covered

The problems span a wide range of topics, including:
- Sorting and Searching
- Graph Theory (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Geometry
- Number Theory
- String Processing
- Recursion and Backtracking

## ✅ Purpose
- Sharpen algorithmic thinking and C++ coding skills
- Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming
- Fulfill course requirements with clean, well-documented code

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio Code / CLion
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
